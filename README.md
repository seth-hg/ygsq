# YGSQ

The name **ygsq** is short for [Wenxin **Y**iyan](https://cloud.baidu.com/wenxin.html)(Ernie), [Chat**G**LM](https://open.bigmodel.cn/), [**S**park](https://xinghuo.xfyun.cn/) and [Tongyi **Q**ianwen](https://help.aliyun.com/zh/dashscope/developer-reference/quick-start). These are the first publicly available Chinese LLM APIs. Ygsq is a wrapper of these APIs, and hopefully with a collection of helpful utilities built on top of them.
